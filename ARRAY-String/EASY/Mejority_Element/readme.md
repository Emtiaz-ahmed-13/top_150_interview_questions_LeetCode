Initialize count to 1 and ans to nums[0], which is 3.

Start iterating from the second element of the list:
        i = 1: nums[1] is 2, not equal to ans (which is 3), so decrement count to 0.
Since count becomes 0, update ans to nums[1], which is 2, and                   reset count to 1.
        Return ans, which is 2.
