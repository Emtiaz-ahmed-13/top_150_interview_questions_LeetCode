1.Initialize index to 0.
2.Loop through the elements of nums using the range(len(nums)) iterator.
3.At each iteration, check if the current element (nums[i]) is not equal to the value val.
4.If it's not equal, update the element at position index in nums with the current element (nums[i]) and then increment index by 1.
5.Repeat steps 3-4 for all elements in nums.
6.Return the final value of index.

Let's go through the iterations:

1.Iteration 1: i = 0, nums[0] = 3, val = 3, since nums[i] == val, do nothing.
2.Iteration 2: i = 1, nums[1] = 2, val = 3, since nums[i] != val, set nums[index] = nums[i] (which is 2), increment index to 1.
3.Iteration 3: i = 2, nums[2] = 2, val = 3, since nums[i] != val, set nums[index] = nums[i] (which is 2), increment index to 2.
4.Iteration 4: i = 3, nums[3] = 3, val = 3, since nums[i] == val, do nothing.
4. After the loop, index is 2, and the modified nums is [2, 2, 2, 3]. The function then returns index, which is 2.

So, for the input nums = [3, 2, 2, 3] and val = 3, the output is 2, and nums becomes [2, 2, 2, 3].
